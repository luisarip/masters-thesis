## Master's thesis, MSc Statistics for Data Science
### Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)

This repository contains the following scripts:

- **Dataset Creation Part 1**: Retrieving datasets from Google Analytics and performing initial web scraping using Beautiful Soup.
- **Dataset Creation Part 2**: Conducting sentiment analysis using the syuzhet package.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing data with iterative web scraping, processing multinomial variables, plotting EDA.
- I implemented three different models:
  - **Poisson regression**: Using a negative binomial to manage overdispersion. 
  - **Bayesian regression**: Using a negative binomial to manage overdispersion.
  - **Neural networks**: Non-informative, but with higher predictive power. 

I also included the datasets obtained and the Markdown documents to prove reproducibility.
